> A simple Smash Up deck builder

## Description
[Smash Up](https://www.alderac.com/smashup/) is a shufflebuilding game from the Alderac Entertainment Group. Players create a play-deck by choosing two faction decks and combining them into one unique whole: you can have My Little Werewolves facing down Steampunk Robots as Time Traveling Wizards flit around.

The game starts with each player choosing two factions: but among my circle that leads to indecision even with the base set, let alone when you pile on the expansions. So this page lets you randomly choose factions for each player and provides a single mulligan.

It was a decent way to play around with Boostrap.
